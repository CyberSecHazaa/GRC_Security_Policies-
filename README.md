# GRC_Security_Policies

Purpose:

Polices are extremely important to set standards for a company. Some polices are complex but some are simple to follow but important to implement and as best aligns with NIST SP 800-63B.

Scope :
The policy applies to all employers, vendors, third-party, contractors who access company resources. 

Important aspects of polices are included but not limited to,

- Must 8+ character passwords 
     A short password may or would be susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks by enforcing 8+ characters, we limit the chance of that password being cracked. 


- A strong password must include a non-pattern, for example Thispass^word123 is bad but ThiSPassWord189! a lot better. 
	 Use a password you can remember but strong, don't reuse it even if it's strong. Hackers can use breaches and databases to see what similar passwords what you've use and use it on a new platform. 


- DO NOT WRITE PASSWORDS DOWN, it defeats the purpose of having good passwords.
	 We tend to forget easy, I do too. Writing it down helps us remember or copy it easily but defeats the purpose scoring the password, despite how good the password would be.

- DO NOT WRITE PASSWORDS on your PC with a file named passwords.txt or any of sort for that matter. 
	 Same goes for PC, it defeats the purpose of having a secure passwords. 


- Encrypted Password Managers are a must
	 If you must write down passwords, you must have a password manager would let you store a lot of passwords which would be access by one password. 


- Change password every 3 months or 90 days, is recommended. 
	 Changes are usually a secure solution in security, by changing your password, you're establishing a strong foundation in being not breached. 


Important Notes : Be aware of phishing links that may be able to grab those credentials by using fake websites that look real.

Extra Notes : Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) if sites/services provided, tedious but worth the time.  

Summary : One easy way to reduce risks is to have a strong password that is not written down, anywhere and can be memorized or if not, can be stored in a trusted password manager.
